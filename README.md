##  Safety is not easily accessible in India, so we created this app, which gives you safety on demand.


## * It sends an editable text message to trusted contacts via a vigorous shake.

## * How we built it: By using Android studio(Language used JAVA, xml and sqlite)

## * Challenges we ran into: Fooling around with the 'static ' variable and intent making.

## * Accomplishments that we're proud of: Helping the needy ones

## * What we learned:Learned how to use 'static' variable and many more...

## * What's next for Safety App: We will remove all the bugs first, then implement sharing of location via message to ambulance services and trusted contacts.
